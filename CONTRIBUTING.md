## Preliminary Information

This project has a [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By contributing you agree to abide by it.

Please also read the [Principles section of README.md](/README.md#principles). It outlines some of the things that this project aims to tackle, as well as a direction to doing so. I hope that reading it will give you clarity on how you could contribute!

## Opening Issues

Before getting to development or PRs, it is preferable to [open an issue](/issues).
This makes it easier to coordinate work, and also to make sure that no efforts are wasted on something that might not get merged.

There are two templates, one for Feature Requests and one for Bugs.
It's possible though that your idea does not fit into either of those.
No worries, you can open an issue without the template, and let us know what you have in mind.

## While Developing

The README has instructions on working [in development](/README.md#development), [in production](/README.md#production), as well as the [lay of the land for file structure and architecture](/README.md#architecture).

I find it hard to predict what else is useful to say here from the outset. I am sure there are things I take for granted having worked on the codebase for a while, but that would be obscure to others. If you run into any of those, and/or have suggestions, please, let me know!

### Creating PRs

There aren't strict rules here, but as a guide:

- Make sure there is a descriptive title
- Please link to the relevant issue, if one is available
- Try to keep PRs focused on one issue/bug/feature

After that, we will have a review, wait for any back-and-forth changes, and in the end merge into the project!

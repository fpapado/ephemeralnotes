ğŸ‘‰ I gave a talk, [**Scaling Elm Apps**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoA4Txr4GUs),
to explain the principles I used to build this. I highly recommend [watching it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoA4Txr4GUs)!

> [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://elm-spa-example.netlify.com/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

For more information on how this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

Check out [the full writeup](https://dev.to/rtfeldman/tour-of-an-open-source-elm-spa)!

# Getting started

I set this up with `make` to show that you can make a SPA in Elm with any
build tool you like! It takes very little configuration.

To build production assets (including minification):

> make

To build local development (including the time-traveling debugger)

> make dev

# Static

- [X] Build pipeline just with npm commands and some light bundling, perhaps
- [X] index.html with inlined critical CSS
- [X] Font and font loading strategy (variable fonts, font-display: swap, preload?)
  - `preload` and `variable-fonts` have some good overlap, so we are not wasting much...
- Github PR pipeline (now integration)
- Script preload
- Brotli compression and type
- namespace (filespace?) js/css assets
- postcss / autoprefixer
- remove unused Tachyons classes
- move SW state to top-level
- [X] style installBanner
- [?] inline all the CSS

# MVP

- idb-keyval and Port architecture
- Data structures
- simple viewer
- App shell

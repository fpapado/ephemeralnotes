# Static

- Build pipeline just with npm commands and some light bundling, perhaps
- index.html with inlined critical CSS
- Font and font loading strategy
- Github PR pipeline
- Script preload
- Brotli compression and type
- namespace (filespace?) js/css assets
- postcss
- move SW state to top-level
- style installBanner
- inline all the CSS
- font preload: use JS and feature-detect variable font support?
  - On the other hand, `preload` and `variable-fonts` have some good overlap, so we are not wasting much...

# MVP

- localstorage and Port architecture
- Data structures
- simple viewer
- App shell
